# Quick-Share
"Anyone has a pen drive?" "No" This is when I felt the need of this script. And all I needed the pendrive was for to get the latest episode of GOT or Silicon Valley :D
To make the whole process simpler and quick this is a super simple script to share any folder over a network. Also transfers over network are less time consuming, and overall more efficient (no waiting over someone's head). Share any file/folder over LAN in seconds!

What it Does
--
You can use it to share a folder of your choice over the network. Whatever directory you will run this script from, that directory and all the contents will be shared over the network.

How to Use
--
1. Download quickshare.py to the folder you want to share over network.
2. In shell, execute 
    python quickshare.py
3. It will ask for port number. You can enter of your choice, else simply press enter, default is 8000.
4. It gives you a URL, share that URL.
